scripts
=======

Just a random collection of some of my scripts... many of them are for the
CB5-311 because I just got one and I've been making scripts for whatever stuff
I want to control.

* `battery.sh` - reads and displays the battery level on CB5-311
* `brightness.sh` - controls/displays the brightness on CB5-311
* `cppreference.sh` - extracts cppreference archive into mkd files
* `reportban.sh` - script that uses gnuplot and geoip to graph fail2ban banned
  ips
* `touchpad.sh` - script that enables/disabled the touchpad on CB5-311
* `wifi.sh` - (lamely) controls the wireless on CB5-311
